1. Descryption
this module is python 3.2 wrapper. it wraps python API in c++.
many python api wrapper can be available in internet.
but many source operate in python version 2.7 or lower.
and python 3.2's API was many changed, specically string(ansi -> unicode)

so i implemented this module for python 3.2
and to hide python api and to use like c++ function call.

2. functionality
except libray, four project exist.
 - a python module's function register and call
 - many python module's function register and call
 - class call
 - python module creation using c++


3. Required
you need download python 3.2. and python 3.2 source code and compile it.
and copy python32.dll, python32_d.dll into Bin32 folder,
and copy libray files to lib folder.
that's it. you can compile, and test it.

source code was tested in visual studio 2008, but it is possible that using in vs2005, vs2010.
